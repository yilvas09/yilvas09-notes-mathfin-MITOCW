# Welcome to My Notes

Hi there.
Welcome to my notes for [Topics in Mathematics with Applications in Finance](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2013/), an online course contributed by MIT Open Course Ware. Thank you so much MIT for making this quality education available for everyone.

## Layout of the Repository
The notes consist of two main sections (as the course name already shows): topics in mathematics, and applications in finance. Subsections with `[0]` prepended include brief introduction of useful results in mathematics most commonly used in finance, while those with `[1]` introduces .

For topics in mathematics, I plan to upload notes for:
* Useful Results in Linear Algebra
* Stochastic Processes (Uploaded)
* Time Series Analysis
* Volatility Modelling

For applications in finance, there will be notes for:
* Portfolio Theory
* Fixed-Income Models
* Commodity Models (my fav lecture)
* Risk-neutral Valuation and Black-Scholes Formula
* Option Price and Probability Duality
* My Personal Glossary for Financial Terms
